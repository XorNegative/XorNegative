I’m a passionate engineer from Germany working for a well known company in the automation navigation market. I always keen to develop my skills. A good pool of knowledge is the open-source and I'm happy to contribute to it.

🌱 I’m interested in Linux and Android system programming
💞️ I would like to collaborate on hardware programming topics.
